# Choose Your Wordle
A customizable adaptation of Wordle!

## Introduction
Hi there! Thanks for checking out my take on the game Wordle. I created this customizable version of the game because I felt that the original one, while undoubtedly fun (and addictive), is too limiting. So, I've gone ahead and implemented some features that can be customized according to the user's liking.

## Features
- Unlimited Mode: No more waiting 24 hours just to play for a few minutes.
- Dark/light Mode (with some of my personal touch on the color scheme)
- Adjustable Guess Count: How about playing on one guess until you hit it?

## Features to be implemented:
- More choices for color schemes
- Different languages (especially Vietnamese since that's my home country)
and more...

## Acknowledgements
WebDevSimplified's Wordle tutorial and Kevin Powel's CSS tutorials have been incredibly helpful during my process of writing web app!
