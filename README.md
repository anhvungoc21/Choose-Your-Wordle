# Choose Your Wordle
A customizable adaptation of Wordle!

## Introduction
Hi there! Thanks for checking out my take on the game Wordle. I created this customizable version of the game because I felt that the original one, while undoubtedly fun (and addictive), is too limiting. So, I've gone ahead and implemented some features that can be customized according to the user's liking.

## Features
- **Unlimited Mode**: No more waiting 24 hours just to play for a few minutes.
- **Dark/light Theme**: (with some of my personal touch on the color scheme)
- **Adjustable Guess Count**: How about playing on one guess until you hit it?

## Features to be implemented:
- More choices for color schemes
- Different languages (especially Vietnamese since that's my home country)
and more...

## Acknowledgements
WebDevSimplified's Wordle tutorial and Kevin Powel's CSS tutorials have been incredibly helpful during my process of writing web app!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions about any features of the game. Have fun!

(P/s: I have not optimized the web app for phone/tablet users, please check this out on your computer!)
